State-driven SPA with Navigo routing and Axios API calls

# Additional Observer Pattern Example Code
The additional classes are exmaples of how you might encapsulate behavior to help clarify state managment. There are tons of frameworks that handle this much better and more effectively than the exmaples provided. To learn more on  observables look at Reactive programming at [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview). 

Hope this helps!
